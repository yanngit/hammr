Getting Started
===============

Hammr is a client command-line tool for a UForge Server. A UForge server can be deployed onsite in your own datacenter, or provided in SaaS by a growing number of hosting providers and UShareSoft.

If you donâ€™t have your own UForge Server, you can get a free online account `here <https://www.usharesoft.com/signup/signup.html>`_ from UShareSoft. Once you have signed up for an account, hammr uses your account to create and manage templates; build machine images; or migrate live systems from one environment to another.
