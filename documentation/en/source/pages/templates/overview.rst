Creating and Managing Templates
===============================

If you have read the Introduction and gone through the step by step tutorial in the Getting Started section, you now have an operational configuration template and have built an image. However, the example probably doesnâ€™t match with the type of machine image you want to create. This section will help you with the basics for creating and managing your template, including how to manage package updates.

You should refer to the section for all the possible parameters you can add to define your template.
